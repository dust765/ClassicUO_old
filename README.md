# Project dust765
This project is to address a problem constructed within the toxicity of this community. This is to show the community, open source projects are not meant for cliques and high school drama but rather the expansion of something greater, innovation. -A penny for your thoughts, the adder that prays beneath the rose.

# Introduction
ClassicUO is an open source implementation of the Ultima Online Classic Client. This client is intended to emulate all standard client versions and is primarily tested against Ultima Online free shards.

The client is currently under heavy development but is functional. The code is based on the [FNA-XNA](https://fna-xna.github.io/) framework. C# is chosen because there is a large community of developers working on Ultima Online server emulators in C#, because FNA-XNA exists and seems reasonably suitable for creating this type of game.
